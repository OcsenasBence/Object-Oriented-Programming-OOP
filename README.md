## Introduction

The exercises in this repository were designed to provide hands-on experience with OOP in Python. Each script addresses a specific domain, modeling real-world entities and their interactions through classes and objects.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP/
├── accommodationmodel.py
├── allatmodel.py
├── cinemamodel.py
├── drinkmodel.py
├── financemodel.py
├── phonemodel.py
├── reviewsmodel.py
└── sportmodel.py

## File Descriptions

- **accommodationmodel.py**: Models various types of accommodations, encapsulating properties such as location, price, and availability.

- **allatmodel.py**: Represents different animals, detailing attributes like species, habitat, and behaviors.

- **cinemamodel.py**: Simulates a cinema system, including classes for movies, screenings, and ticket bookings.

- **drinkmodel.py**: Defines various beverages, capturing details such as ingredients, volume, and nutritional information.

- **financemodel.py**: Implements financial instruments or accounts, managing attributes like balance, transactions, and interest rates.

- **phonemodel.py**: Models different phone devices, encompassing properties like brand, model, specifications, and functionalities.

- **reviewsmodel.py**: Handles user reviews for products or services, storing information such as reviewer details, ratings, and comments.

- **sportmodel.py**: Represents various sports, detailing aspects like rules, player positions, and scoring systems.

## Getting Started

To explore these models:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OcsenasBence/Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP.git
   cd Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP
   

2. *Ensure Python is Installed*: These scripts are written in Python. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

Each script is self-contained. To run a specific model:

python filename.py

Replace filename.py with the desired script's name. For example:

python cinemamodel.py
